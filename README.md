# rgcnn_pytorch
This is a rewriting of the code from [RGCNN](https://github.com/tegusi/RGCNN) paper in PyTorch-Geometric.

You can find the paper used [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02952).

This is a Work in Progress, hence all the tests are done in a Jupyter Notebook file. Once the code is ready and tested we will add a python file.
